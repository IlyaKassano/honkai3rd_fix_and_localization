  VAL: "Human (Honkai Impact 3)"
  honkai648_energy: "Honkai Energy"
  honkai648_energy_desc: "Einstein once explained the nature of Honkai Energy:\nThe second law of thermodynamics states that if the entropy of a system decreases, it must cause the entropy of another system to increase by a greater amount. From an information perspective, there is a huge information asymmetry between a chaotic environment with highly chaotic information and a negentropy environment with highly ordered information. Historical studies have shown that Honkai Energy has a strong accompanying relationship with this information asymmetry. In mathematics, the imaginary energy belonging to the collapsed dimension can be expressed in a unified way with the real energy represented by the thermodynamic representation of the divergent dimension - the four-dimensional space-time that we can normally perceive - through high-dimensional complex functions. The result can predict the fluctuation of Honkai at the microscopic scale. Therefore, current researchers generally speculate that this \"imaginary energy\" is Honkai Energy, or at least an important component of Honkai Energy. \nThe above content is purely fictitious, and Honkai Energy actually means \"Honkai can do anything\"."

Now we can fuse Honkai beast genes into every individual with Stigmata. Unlike the previous civilization, we will only modify individuals with Stigmata, with a 100% success rate for modifying individuals with Stigmata."

  hk648_star.1000.desc: "To confront the Honkai, we not only need a large number of leaders, but also high-quality talents. Based on our years of experience in confronting the Honkai, high-quality talents are more helpful to us than a group of disorganized individuals. So, do we need to spend resources to rebuild St. Freya Academy to cultivate high-quality talents that meet our needs?"
  st_freya_DESC: "Freya is a goddess in mythology, and we named the academy after her, hoping that the academy can lead the Valkyries like Freya."

  ###### Main Story ######
  star_2000a.response: "People may need some time to accept all this. We should slowly tell people about the knowledge related to the Honkai through some artistic works."
  star_2000b.response: "The Honkai won't give us time. We need everyone to understand this clearly."
  star_2000c.response: "This may not be a good choice. Paper can't wrap up fire, and one day they will know everything. We cannot predict what will happen then."
  star_2103.response: "§YKiana§! Become the Fleet Commander\n§YYae Sakura§! Become the Fleet Commander\n§YBronya§! Become the Fleet Commander"

  star_21031a.response: "You shamelessly made a dirty deal with Ai-chan."
  
  hk648_star.2000.desc: "Since we started using Honkai Energy again, the frequency of Honkai disasters has been increasing. Telling people about Honkai disasters may cause some level of chaos, but concealing them is like burying a time bomb. What should we do?"
  hk648_star.2101.desc: "Fiction is not nonsense, adaptation is not fabrication. Through gaming, we can tell people about the Honkai disasters that occurred hundreds of years ago in history."
  hk648_star.2102.desc: "The Kiana Fantasy is our attempt to integrate Honkai knowledge and entertainment industry. Its success will determine our subsequent plans."
  hk648_star.2103.desc: "In the past year, Kiana Fantasy has achieved amazing results. We should seize the opportunity to launch a new game to show people the Honkai disasters we encountered during the era of our mother planet. What plan should we adopt for the protagonist of the new game?"
  hk648_star.21031.desc: "Boss, I heard that Honkai Impact 3 is about to start character selection? Ai-chan thinks that the protagonist of Honkai Impact 3 is tailor-made for the world's cutest Ai-chan. What do you think, boss?"
  hk648_star.21032.desc: "Ai-chan knows that the boss's vision is never wrong. A little kindness is a sign of respect."
  hk648_star.21033.desc: "Tsk, stingy~"
  hk648_star.2104.desc: "A sufficiently excellent female protagonist can make our game more outstanding. We need to carefully select the candidate for the female lead. So, who should we choose to play the female lead in Honkai Impact 3?"
  hk648_star.21041.desc: "The supporting female character has a lot of lines, most of which are performed alongside the female lead. Therefore, we should choose a supporting actress who can perfectly cooperate with the female lead."
  hk648_star.21042.desc: "The supporting character is an indispensable part of a work. An excellent supporting character can enhance the expressive power of the work. We should carefully select who will play the important role of the female lead's teacher."
  hk648_star.21043.desc: "In the audition, the actors will randomly draw characters and scripts, and perform in groups of two to three. Let us enjoy the actors' performances together."
  hk648_star.21044.desc: "Chapter 6 finale \"Awakening\"： The female protagonist wakes up in a virtual space and is captured by a powerful enemy. Her aunt, Lilia Arwin, lies critically injured on the ground. \nThe female protagonist： Rosalia Arwin \nAunt： Lilia Arwin \nAntagonist： Rita Rossweisse \n\nAunt： \"What are you doing here, female protagonist?\" \nFemale protagonist： \"Aunt! I just defeated the Second Lawmaker with my mother!\" \nAunt： \"Come back with me quickly. This place...\" \nAntagonist： \"Principal, I am sorry, but I have to ask you to leave temporarily.\" Your mother is not here, female protagonist. \nFemale protagonist： \"No, this cannot be true!\" \nAntagonist： \"It's a conspiracy of that lawmaker, which made you immersed in your dream. Female protagonist, it's time to wake up.\""
  hk648_star.21045.desc: "Chapter 4 finale \"Affectionate Confrontation\"： The female protagonist confronts the traitorous female No.3 to rescue the female No.2. The traitorous female No.3 recalls the tenderness of the female No.2 and decides to burn the chip in her brain. \nFemale No.1： Bronya Zaychik \nFemale No.2： Kiana Kaslana \nFemale No.3： Rosalia Arwin \n\nFemale No.1： \"...give me back the female No.2. Female No.3, don't let them control you anymore.\" \nFemale No.3： \"When I was young, I lost my parents. It was the female No.2 who made me feel warmth again. I don't want to hurt her either. So, I won't fight, and I have burned the biological chip.\" \nFemale No.1： \"What? The biological chip is implanted in your brain. Are you crazy?\" \nFemale No.3： \"Female No.1,\" I will leave the female No.2 to you. I hope you both will be happy.\""
  hk648_star.21046.desc: "Chapter 9 finale \"Last Lesson\"： The female protagonist becomes completely blackened and turns into a lawmaker under the scheme of the big antagonist. Her teacher, Rosalia Arwin, clears a path of blood and wakes her up with love. \nFemale protagonist： Kiana Kaslana \nTeacher： Rosalia Arwin \n\nTeacher： \"Female protagonist, when you wake up, you will find that everything has changed. You will find that this world is no longer beautiful, and those ordinary days will never return. But don't give up, never give up!\" \nFemale protagonist： \"Stop it, don't be so complacent!\" \nTeacher： \"Go and make this imperfect story into the one you expect!\""
  hk648_star.2105.desc: "The casting for Honkai Impact 3rd has been completed, and we have selected the most suitable actors to play each role. We hope they can fully show themselves and present an exciting story in Honkai Impact 3rd. The actors are ready, and now we just need to make Honkai Impact 3rd."
  hk648_star.2106.desc: "Honkai Impact 3rd has been completed. This game will lead people to understand Honkai and also make public the heroic deeds of Valkyries fighting against Honkai. Now, we just need to wait for people from all walks of life to mature in their understanding of the game and Honkai itself."
  hk648_star.21071.desc: "From Chiyou, to Yae Village, to the Black Death, to the Second Honkai, and now to the interstellar era, the goodwill between people has achieved what we are today. It is this goodwill that makes us firm in our beliefs, and we will pass on this belief to more people. Each Valkyrie is a small but indispensable spark of the ever-burning flame. Because the world is not beautiful, we yearn for beauty, and that is the meaning of fighting for all that is good in the world."
  hk648_star.21072.desc: "In the past period of time, Honkai Impact 3rd has achieved amazing success. Countless players have gone crazy for the protagonist and the second female lead, and Vodka Girl has become a nationally famous super idol. Although it deviates a bit from our goal of inspiring people's fighting spirit, at least they are now willing to fight for the good in the world. I think we should consider developing the idol industry. PS： Vodka Girl never drinks vodka."
  hk648_star.21073.desc: "Although the actors' performances had some flaws, with the support of the official, a large number of players flooded into Honkai Impact 3rd. Obviously, Honkai Impact 3rd has achieved success nationwide, and the concept of Honkai has spread to every corner of the country. Now everyone understands the threat of Honkai clearly. Let us unite and face everything that Honkai brings together."
  hk648_star.21074.desc: "The Last Lesson is a scene from Chapter 9 of Honkai Impact 3rd. The performance of Tower of Babel's Himeko has shocked everyone. Countless people mourned for the protagonist's teacher. At this moment, people deeply realize the cost behind the slogan of \"fighting for all that is good in the world,\" but this is not a reason to retreat. Someday, humanity will defeat Honkai, and someday, the world will become what we want it to be."
  hk648_star.21075.desc: "Since the birth of human civilization, Honkai has been like the Sword of Damocles hanging over our heads, always ready to destroy our civilization. The Captain once said, \"It is not shameful to fall under the opponent's sword. It is shameful to not dare to draw one's own sword.\" We must draw our swords in the face of the enemy, even if the opponent is Honkai!"
  hk648_star.2201.desc: "After we announced the Honkai disaster to the public, the whole empire went crazy. In order to protect ourselves from Honkai, we will burst out with unprecedented potential. We will definitely defeat Honkai."
  hk648_star.2202.desc: "Drawing pies to satisfy hunger is not the right way. The enthusiasm of the people will not last forever. It can be foreseen that in at most fifteen years, most people will become numb. We must find some means to bring the people back on track."
  hk648_star.2203.desc: "Come back to explore the front area later."

The expected strength of the Honkai beasts that will appear is between §Y40k-100k§!, and we must be prepared to fight a tough battle."
  hk648_honkai.4002.desc: "The previous Honkai Outburst occurred very suddenly, even though it was only a small one, it still caused us a lot of trouble. In order to ensure that the army is deployed before the Honkai Outburst arrives, we need to develop a device to predict the time and strength of the Honkai Outburst."
  hk648_honkai.4003.desc: "We have completed the research on the Honkai warning system on our home planet and can now deploy it on any planet."

We may even need to be prepared to abandon the entire planet."

Shall I make you a bowl of noodles?"
  hk648_honkai.8007.desc: "That's right, we can talk while we eat.\nHere's the situation： You once killed the Second Lawmaker and took her core. When a new Second Lawmaker Core appears, the two cores will resonate.
