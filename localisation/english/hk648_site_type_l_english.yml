She believes that Theresa, who possesses the Key of God, does not have the responsibility and faith commensurate with this enormous power, and warns Theresa, who insists on entering the ruins.

When the rescue team entered the ruins, they found that A1 had already fallen into Theresa's arms. After A1 fell, no power to resist destiny appeared in the ruins, and Destiny smoothly obtained the technology and resources left behind by the ancient civilization. However, no information about the so-called 'key to the end of the world' was found. Perhaps the key is not here. Theresa took A1's main body away, and although awakening A1 would cause her to lose most of her memories and abilities, Theresa still insisted on researching how to awaken A1, perhaps as a form of redemption for her past."

    hk648_cocoon_of_finality: "Remnants of an Ancient Civilization"
    hk648_cocoon_of_finality_desc: "Recently, an energy wave from the Sea of Quanta caused some people to be swept up and transported to this location. Experts believe they were transported here by an unknown entity through the Sea of Quanta. The equipment in this ruins has been transferred to Earth for minimal use of Honkai energy after severing imaginary space connections. But it seems that there are still secrets here that we have yet to uncover."

    #Phase 1
    hk648_cocoon_of_finality.0001.name: "New Atlantis"
    hk648_cocoon_of_finality.0001.desc: "After a period of preparation, the scientific research team and search and rescue team arrived at the ruins. The data shows that this ruins was excavated decades ago and the equipment was already transferred to Earth. But reality gave us a harsh slap in the face: there must still be secrets here that we have not discovered yet."
    hk648_cocoon_of_finality.0001.a: "Enter the ruins"

    #Phase 2
    hk648_cocoon_of_finality.0002.name: "Refuge"
    hk648_cocoon_of_finality.0002.desc: "Using previous data, the scientific research team and search and rescue team easily entered the ruins and found a refuge from the ancient civilization. All the equipment here had been removed, leaving behind an empty shell that appeared to be of no value. But just as the scientific research team was about to give up, a faint signal was detected in the center of the square. According to records, this square was possibly used by the ancient civilization for some kind of ritual, and it seems that we are about to overturn our previous conclusions."
    hk648_cocoon_of_finality.0002.a: "Let the scientific research team carefully explore the square."
 
    ##Phase Three
    hk648_cocoon_of_finality.0003.name: "Under the Square"
    hk648_cocoon_of_finality.0003.desc: "As the exploration goes deeper, the research team found that the surface plaza is only the top floor of this building, and there is another world beneath it. The plaza itself is not a common object, but a small Stargate that connects to the Sea Source City on Earth. Obviously, those disappeared people in Sea Source City before accidentally triggered the Stargate and were transported here. Fortunately, there are no armed equipment here, except for the stampede caused by panic, no other dangerous incidents have occurred. The search and rescue team evacuated the relic with the people, while the research team continued to explore deeper, and this relic must still preserve something left by the ancient civilization."
    hk648_cocoon_of_finality.0003.a: "Continue Forward"

    ##Phase Four
    hk648_cocoon_of_finality.0004.name: "Database"
    hk648_cocoon_of_finality.0004.desc: "At the bottom of the plaza, there is a database from the ancient civilization. Unlike the databases in other relics, it records a lot of content that has not been recorded in other relics. This information directly points to the origin of the Honkai, and even subverts our cognition. The data here shows that the god we have always believed in, the Honkai will, is actually the super artificial intelligence Prometheus of the ancient civilization. Behind the information in the database, there is a location that many of them point to, and the Stargate seems to serve this place. The research team believes that we must figure out what is still hidden in this location."
    hk648_cocoon_of_finality.0004.a: "Try to go to the mysterious location through the Stargate"

    ##Phase Five
    hk648_cocoon_of_finality.0005.name: "Cocoon of the End"
    hk648_cocoon_of_finality.0005.desc: "After passing through the Stargate, the research team arrived at a place similar to a virtual reality. Here, the stars in the sky flickered, and the ground was as clear as glass, reflecting the starry sky. In front of the research team was a huge egg-shaped object embedded in the ground, with only half of it exposed. In the middle of it, there was a four-pointed star-shaped gap, emitting a beautiful purple light. It seems that this purple light is the essence of this object, and the surface rocks are just its shell. According to the records of the ancient civilization, this egg-shaped object is the Cocoon of the End. If we can fully understand it, our accomplishments in Honkai energy will be further improved. And we have already cut off the imaginary connection for hundreds of years, and the Cocoon of the End is now in its weakest state, which is our opportunity."
    hk648_cocoon_of_finality.0005.a: "Start researching the Cocoon of the End"

    ##Phase Six

    hk648_cocoon_of_finality.0006.desc: "Under the round-the-clock efforts of our research team, we have successfully controlled the Cocoon of Finality, and we have almost grasped the essence of Honkai energy. Honkai energy is just a special kind of energy, with its high-dimensional characteristics making it almost omnipotent in its performance. Now that we have almost completely understood Honkai energy, we can use this magical energy more efficiently. \n§Y(Unlock Honkai Ascension II)§!"
