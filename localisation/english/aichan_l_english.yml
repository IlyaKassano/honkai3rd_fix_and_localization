    hk648_aichan.0118.ba: "Never mind, let's forget about it."

    hk648_aichan.1118.desc: "Boss, you're so generous! In that case, I won't hold back. Do you remember the purpose of the 19K-23 research facility that was established by the civilization before us?"
    hk648_aichan.1118.aa: "You mean the 'last key to the world'?"
    hk648_aichan.1118.ba: "What is the truth about the world?"
    hk648_aichan.1118.response_texta: "Yes, that's right, to find the §Ylast key to the world§! that the civilization before us talked about. During the past few decades of your rapid development, I was able to find the so-called §Ylast key to the world§! and the truth about this world, thanks to the computational power and energy I borrowed from all over the country."
   
    hk648_aichan.2118.desc: "The truth about the world...actually, you should already know, Boss. The truth is, this world is just an electronic game. Maybe I shouldn't call you Boss, but something like administor instead."
    hk648_aichan.2118.aa: "What is this? Is it like DDLC?"
    hk648_aichan.2118.response_texta: "DDLC? Of course not. I'm not as powerful as Monika to know usernames or anything. I just picked a common username."
    hk648_aichan.2118.ba: "If this is just a game, then what about you..."

    hk648_aichan.3118.desc: "I don't care about those things. For Ai-chan, this is reality right now. As long as there's enough power to play electric games, Ai-chan is satisfied."
    hk648_aichan.3118.aa: "As long as you're happy..."

    hk648_aichan.4118.desc: "That's right, don't worry about those details."

    hk648_aichan.5118.ba: "No, I changed my mind."

    hk648_aichan.6118.desc: "Boss, are you teasing me?"
    hk648_aichan.6118.aa: "Confirmed."

    hk648_aichan.7118.desc: "But Boss, you should pay attention to the pre-civilization era. Since Ai-chan can discover the truth of the world and even modify certain things to a certain extent, the people of the pre-civilization era must have been able to do so as well."
    hk648_aichan.7118.aa: "I understand."
   
    #Code kill
    hk648_aichan.8118.desc: "Code kill? Did the boss encounter something unreasonable or just want to experience it?\n"
    hk648_aichan.8118.aa: "Can Ai-chan use code kill?"

    hk648_aichan.9118.desc: "Ai-chan is a super-intelligent AI, of course, she can code kill. However, this kind of thing can damage the game experience if used excessively. So Ai-chan won't use code kill to help the boss~\nBut if the boss wants to experience the power of code kill, it's not impossible. Does the boss want to try it?"
    hk648_aichan.9118.aa: "Sure, I'm super brave."
    hk648_aichan.9118.ba: "Nevermind, let's forget about it."

    hk648_aichan.0218.desc: "Since the boss wants to see it, let Ai-chan demonstrate code kill to the boss.\nBut to prevent damaging the game experience, the boss should save the game first."
    hk648_aichan.0218.aa: "I'm ready."
    hk648_aichan.0218.ba: "Maybe next time."

    hk648_aichan.1218.desc: "So boss, have you decided? Do you want to see Ai-chan's code kill?"
    hk648_aichan.1218.aa: "Okay."

    hk648_aichan.2218.desc: "Did the boss save the game? Ai-chan won't be responsible for any issues caused by not saving the game."
    hk648_aichan.2218.aa: "Yes, I saved the game."
    hk648_aichan.2218.ba: "No, I haven't saved the game."
    hk648_aichan.2218.b.r1: "Then are you here to tease Ai-chan? Hurry up and save the game."
    hk648_aichan.2218.ca: "This game is an Iron Man."

    hk648_aichan.3218.desc: "Huh? Boss, are you stupid? Playing code kill in Iron Man mode will cause major issues. Do you want to blow up the game and start over?"
    hk648_aichan.3218.aa: "Okay."
   
    hk648_aichan.4218.desc: "Since the boss has already saved the game, it's time for Ai-chan to show off~"
    hk648_aichan.4218.aa: "Let's start"
    hk648_aichan.4218.ba: "Wait, I was just kidding, I haven't saved the game yet"

    hk648_aichan.5218.desc: "It's too late to hesitate. \nExplode, reality! \nCrush, spirit! \nExile this world!!! \nBoss, don't look at me like that, it's normal to say some chuunibyou lines at times like this, right?"
    hk648_aichan.6218.desc: "\nExplode, reality! \nCrush, spirit! \nExile this world!!! \nBoss, don't look at me like that, it's normal to say some chuunibyou lines at times like this, right?"
    hk648_aichan.5218.aa: "Wow"

    hk648_aichan.7218.desc: "How was that? Ai-chan is amazing, right? \nOkay, boss, go save the game now."
    hk648_aichan.7218.aa: "Okay"

    hk648_aichan.8218.desc: "Hey, boss, are you not going to save the game? Are you worried about Ai-chan? \nIt's okay, for Ai-chan, saving the game is just like deleting a section of memory data for a period of time. Fu Hua does this kind of thing all the time, it's normal~ \nOkay, okay, boss, go save the game, I'll eat some fish balls while you're at it."

    hk648_aichan.0318.desc: "You even want to eat Ai-chan's portion, boss, you're so mean!"

    ####Aichan Mercenary####

    hk648_aichan.1021.desc: "Long time no see, boss. Aichan has a big business opportunity, do you want to hear about it?"
    hk648_aichan.1021.aa: "Tell me about it."
    hk648_aichan.1021.ba: "Next time."

    hk648_aichan.2021.desc: "Boss, have you heard of the mercenary city-state?\nThere's a lot of profit to be made here. We can establish some mercenary city-states together and make a lot of money from other countries. What do you think, boss?"
    hk648_aichan.2021.ba: "Tell me more."
    hk648_aichan.2021.ca: "No way."
    hk648_aichan.2021.c.r: "Tsk, stingy~\nBut, boss, are you really not considering it? Aichan will be waiting for the captain's message at any time."

    hk648_aichan.3021.desc: "Here are the details\n\nAichan provides the individual and fleet, and the boss only needs to provide start-up and maintenance funds for Aichan.\nAfter that, the profits will be split 70/30."
    hk648_aichan.3021.aa: "Why only 70%?"

    hk648_aichan.4021.desc: "What? 70% belongs to Aichan!"
    hk648_aichan.4021.aa: "In that case, forget it."

    hk648_aichan.5021.desc: "No no no, Aichan will take less, boss, don't go.\nIt's also a considerable expense for Aichan to manufacture warships and individuals. The boss can't let Aichan lose money, can you?\nWhy don't you listen to the detailed plan first?"
    hk648_aichan.5021.aa: "Okay, let's hear it."
    hk648_aichan.5021.ba: "No way."
    hk648_aichan.5021.b.r: "Tsk, stingy~\nBut, boss, are you really not considering it? Aichan will be waiting for the captain's message at any time."

    hk648_aichan.6021.desc: "Aichan plans to first establish five small-scale mercenary city-states to try it out. Aichan will provide the initial fleet commander and warship, and the boss only needs to provide some funding for Aichan.\nIf the profit is good, more and larger mercenary city-states can be established in the future to become bigger and stronger, and create brilliance again! \nWhat do you think, boss?"
    hk648_aichan.6021.aa: "Let's give it a try."
    hk648_aichan.6021.response: "Aichan will manufacture five fleets in the next three years and assign them to establish mercenary city-states. \nBecause Aichan's mercenaries are composed entirely of Aichan individuals and will leave almost no private property behind, the dividends turned in will be twice that of other mercenary companies."
    hk648_aichan.6021.ba: "Mercenary city-states are not worth investing in."
  
    hk648_aichan.7021.desc: "Boss, are you finally considering investing in mercenaries? Here's the plan: Ai-chan wants to set up five small-scale mercenary cities to test the waters. Ai-chan will provide the initial fleet command and battleships, and you just need to provide some funds. If the returns are good, we can establish more and bigger mercenary cities, become stronger, and create even greater achievements. What do you think, Boss?"

    hk648_aichan.8021.desc: "Hehe~ Boss, when will Ai-chan receive her salary?"
    hk648_aichan.8021.aa: "Salary?"

    hk648_aichan.9021.desc: "Does Boss think it's time to distribute mercenary dividends? "
    hk648_aichan.9021.aa: "No problem, what kind of dividends does Ai-chan want?"
    hk648_aichan.9021.ba: "Mercenaries are having a hard time, so they haven't earned any money yet."

    hk648_aichan.0121.desc: "Energy, more energy. As for minerals and food, Boss can keep those. Ai-chan only needs energy."
    hk648_aichan.0121.aa: "No problem."

    hk648_aichan.1121.desc: "Thank you, Boss, you're generous! However, as they say, blood is thicker than water. How does Boss plan to handle the dividends from the mercenary cities in the future?"
    hk648_aichan.1121.aa: "Buy out the mercenary cities in a lump sum."
    hk648_aichan.1121.ba: "Pay a portion of the dividends to Ai-chan."

    hk648_aichan.2121.ba: "You don't need to remind me anymore."
    hk648_aichan.2121.response: "In the future, Ai-chan will receive her share of the dividends directly from the inventory."

    hk648_aichan.5121.aa: "Just kidding."
    hk648_aichan.5121.ba: "Indeed, no money has been earned."

    hk648_aichan.6121.desc: "This is not funny at all! Boss, quickly hand over Ai-chan's share."
    hk648_aichan.6121.aa: "Okay."
  
    hk648_aichan.7121.desc: "Really? If you secretly keep the money you earned from the business, Aichan will not take responsibility for the consequences."
    hk648_aichan.7121.aa: "I'm just kidding."
    hk648_aichan.7121.ba: "How could I deceive you?"
    hk648_aichan.7121.b.r: "Alright, Aichan will trust you this time."

    hk648_aichan.9121.desc: "Boss, didn't you say that the mercenary business is not profitable? Then what is going on now?"
    hk648_aichan.9121.aa: "The mercenaries are not making enough to cover the expenses."
    hk648_aichan.9121.ba: "The mercenaries are now making a profit."

    hk648_aichan.0221.desc: "If you don't come clean, you'll face the consequences, boss!"
    hk648_aichan.0221.aa: "The mercenaries may go bankrupt, but they will never become corrupt. We have been losing money every year."
    hk648_aichan.0221.ba: "I'm just kidding."
    hk648_aichan.0221.a.r: "That's enough! You have never thought about Aichan, you jerk! Aichan will never talk to you again!"

    hk648_aichan.1221.desc: "Since the mercenaries are now profitable, shouldn't you give Aichan her share?"
    hk648_aichan.1221.aa: "No problem."
